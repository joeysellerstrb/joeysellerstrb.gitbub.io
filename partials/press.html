  <h1 >BIO</h1>
  <h2 >Joey Sellers</h2>

<p>Born
in Phoenix, Arizona in 1962, Joey Sellers is recipient of the <b>Gil Evans Fellowship In Jazz Composition</b>,
the <b>Sammy Nestico Award</b>, and the <b>Julius Hemphill Award</b>. An accomplished
composer in both jazz and classical idioms, Sellers has written for Doc
Severinsen, the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, symphony orchestras in Tulsa,
Long Beach and San Antonio and several works commissioned by the St. Louis
Brass. Warner Brothers, Advance Music, and Hal Leonard have published his music
and transcriptions. He has received grants from the American Music Center, Meet
the Composer, and the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</p>


<p>Sellers attended Arizona State University where he
studied trombone with Gail Wilson and improvisation with Chuck Marohnic. In
1980, he formed the Tempe Jazz Workshop, an 11-piece ensemble to perform his
original music.</p>

<p>Sellers moved to Los Angeles in 1985, where he
performed actively on piano and trombone. The 11-piece ensemble manifested
itself there as the Jazz Aggregation, and that ensemble's recordings and
performances garnered critical praise. The <i >Los
Angeles Times</i> says of the ensemble, <b >"[Joey
Sellers'] Jazz Aggregation is one of the most exciting new surprises of the
decade." </b>The <i>Penguin Guide to Jazz</i>
states of the Aggregation's 9Winds release <u>Pastels, Ashes</u> <b>"Sellers blends structure and surprise with
a deftness that should leave other arrangers genuflecting." </b>In Los Angeles,
Sellers played and recorded with the Kim Richmond/Clay Jenkins Ensemble, Joe
LaBarbara, Bruce Fowler, Allen Vizzutti and Bobby Shew. He studied
improvisation with Warne Marsh, and jazz composition with Bill Holman. During
this period, Sellers also served as music director, trombonist and pianist for
the Side Street Strutters, reworking and adapting the music of Jelly Roll
Morton, Duke Ellington, Fats Waller, Fletcher Henderson and other seminal jazz
figures for that ensemble's six recordings for StopTime Records.</p>


<p>Moving to New York in 1996 to pursue more intense
musical endeavors, Sellers played and recorded with Conrad Herwig, Dave
Liebman, Toshiko Akiyoshi's Orchestra featuring Lew Tabackin, Kenny Wheeler
Large Ensemble, Satoko Fujii Orchestra, Mike Formanek and Tony Malaby, among
others. The New York incarnation of the Jazz Aggregation was well received, with
the <i>New York Times</i> commenting, <b>"Sellers is one of few composers whose
ideas actually press into new shapes; it's not just a half dozen soloists
coloring a big band core." </b><i >The
Village Voice</i><b> </b>states simply, <b>"There's little typical about his pen." </b></p>

<p>A short list of Sellers' commissions includes:
<b>"Three Fantasies for Steelpan and
Orchestra"</b> for Liam Teague, <b>"</b>Concerto
for Jazz Piano and Orchestra<b>"</b> for Chuck Marohnic, <b>Odd Children: Piece for Marimba and Wind Ensemble</b> for Robert
Chappell,<b>"Three Essays/Four Saxophones"</b> for the Northern Illinois University
Saxophone Quartet, <b>"Aperitif, Tale,
Digression and Entr√©e for Tuba and Clarinet"</b> for Sam Pilafian and Robert
Spring, <b>Requiems </b>for Wayne Bergeron,
and <b>"Miss Rogers' Boots"</b> for the
Airmen of Note.</b></p>


<p>Sellers was assistant professor of music at Northern
Illinois University; he is currently Director of Jazz Studies at Saddleback
College. He lives in Mission Viejo, California with his wife, clarinetist Susan
Sellers, and their children, Corissa and Benjamin.</p>
